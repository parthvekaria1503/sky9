BrowserRouter (aliased as Router here) wraps your entire application. It enables the routing functionality.
Routes is a container for all your Route elements.
Route specifies a path and the component that should be rendered when the path matches.
Link is used for navigation. It allows users to move between different routes without reloading the page.
